# HVAC_device_DRL_control
Single HVAC device component control with DRL

The algorithm based on DRL is applied on precision HVAC device for energy conservation.

DDPG, PPO, SAC is tested in this project.

DDPG needs more exp. for training and gets a stable control preformance after nearly 30k epoches.

PPO receives a not bad results with 10k to 20k epoches, and SAC is tested right now.
